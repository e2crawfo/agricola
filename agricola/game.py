  Parameters
  ----------

    The actions to include in the game. The first sublist corresponds
    to actions that are available from the beginning of the game. Each
    subsequent list gives the actions that become available in the
    corresponding stage.
  n_players: int > 0
    Number of players.
  initial_players: Player instance or list thereof (optional)
    If a Player instance, each player is created as a copy of this player.
    If a list, length must be equal to ``n_players`` (allows specifying
    different starting configurations for different players). If not
    supplied, the default starting configuration is used for every player.
  occupations: instance of Deck
    Pool of occupations to draw from.
  minor_improvements: instance of Deck
    Pool of minor improvements to draw from.
  major_improvements: list of MajorImprovement instances
    Pool of major improvements to draw from.
  randomize: bool (default: True)
    If False, respect the within-stage ordering of actions in ``actions``.
    Otherwise, randomize the order of the actions within a stage.
